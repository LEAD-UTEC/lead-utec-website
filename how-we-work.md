**Purpose:** Detailed explanation of LEAD UTEC's organizational structure and operational model  
**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026  
**Status:** Ready for implementation  

---

## OVERVIEW

LEAD UTEC takes a fresh approach to student leadership. We operate like a startup—organized around Squads (project teams) that execute real initiatives aligned to six strategic thematic axes. Every member leads or contributes to projects that create tangible impact.

---

## SQUAD-BASED MODEL

### What is a Squad?

At LEAD UTEC, all work happens through **Squads**—temporary teams formed around specific projects or initiatives. Each Squad has a Project Owner, 1-3 contributors, and support from our five transversal departments (Marketing, Talent, Operations, Strategy, and Product). Squads exist only while the project is active and dissolve once objectives are met. This ensures we stay lean, focused, and execution-driven.

### Squad Structure

**Project Owner**  
The Squad leader responsible for:
- Defining project objectives and success metrics
- Coordinating with contributors and departments
- Making final decisions on project direction
- Ensuring timely delivery and quality standards
- Reporting progress to Executive Board

**Contributors (1-3 members)**  
Active Squad members who:
- Execute specific tasks aligned to their skills
- Collaborate on problem-solving and ideation
- Maintain project momentum between meetings
- Develop new skills through hands-on work

**Transversal Department Support**  
Five departments provide specialized support:
- **Marketing & Communications:** Content, campaigns, brand alignment
- **Talent & People Development:** Team composition, skill development
- **Operations & Project Management:** Resource allocation, process optimization
- **Strategy & Growth:** Strategic alignment, metrics tracking, partnerships
- **Product & Innovation:** Technical tools, process innovation

### Squad Lifecycle

1. **Formation:** Project Owner proposes initiative aligned to thematic axis
2. **Approval:** Executive Board reviews and approves project
3. **Team Building:** Contributors recruited based on skills and interest
4. **Execution:** Squad executes in 2-4 week sprints with regular check-ins
5. **Completion:** Deliverables met, impact measured, learnings documented
6. **Dissolution:** Squad disbands, members join new projects

### Why Squads Work

- **Focused execution:** No endless meetings, only action-oriented work
- **Clear ownership:** Every project has a designated leader
- **Flexibility:** Teams form and dissolve based on organizational needs
- **Skill development:** Members work on diverse projects across different domains
- **Scalability:** We can run multiple projects simultaneously without bureaucracy
